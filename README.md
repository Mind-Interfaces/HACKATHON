# MusiCube: Interactive Pygame Music Generator

MusiCube is an innovative pygame project that utilizes the powerful musicgen model from the audiocraft library to create unique musical compositions based on user interactions within a captivating 3D environment. This project offers an engaging musical experience where users can actively participate in the music generation process.

## Project Overview

The core of MusiCube lies in its ability to generate music by analyzing the user's interactions with a dynamic 3D interface. The interface consists of various cubes, each serving a distinct purpose:

- **Controller Cube (White)**: This cube serves as the user's avatar within the 3D space. Users can navigate it using the arrow keys.

- **Collision Cubes (Green and Cyan)**: The environment is adorned with green and cyan cubes. Colliding with these cubes triggers different musical effects.

## User Interactions

MusiCube leverages user interactions to influence the music generation process:

- **Green Cube Collisions**: Every time a player collides with a green cube, a music genre token is generated. Tokens can range from "soothing" to "guitar", "rock", "pop", and more. These tokens are accumulated in a list, preparing a prompt for music generation. For instance, a sequence of collisions resulting in the tokens "soothing", "guitar", and "rock" would build a prompt list like [soothing, guitar, rock]. Each green cube collision also adds 10 points to the player's score.

- **Cyan Cube Collisions**: A collision with a cyan cube signals the game to send the accumulated prompt list to the MusicGen model, initiating the generation of new background music based on the collected tokens. Successfully sending tokens to MusicGen through a cyan cube collision rewards the player with a bonus of 1000 points per token.


## üéñ Scoring System

MusiCube introduces a dynamic scoring mechanism, adding a competitive edge to the musical journey:

- üü¢ **Green Cube**: Each collision earns you **10 points**. Collect music tokens and watch your score soar!
- üü¶ **Cyan Cube**: Successfully send tokens to the AI and bag a whopping **1000 points**. Strategize and maximize your score!
- ‚ö´ **Dark Cube**: Beware! Colliding with these cubes will cause you to lose all tokens and cost you a life. But fear not, you start with **9 lives**. Strive for that high score!
 
## Music Generation and Playback

The accumulated prompt list is sent to the musicgen model after a series of collisions. The model then generates music based on the provided prompts. The resulting composition is played in a loop until a new prompt is constructed through further interactions.
