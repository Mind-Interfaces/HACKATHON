# MusiCube: Interactive Pygame Music Generator

MusiCube is an innovative pygame project that utilizes the powerful musicgen model from the audiocraft library to create unique musical compositions based on user interactions within a captivating 3D environment. This project offers an engaging musical experience where users can actively participate in the music generation process.

## Project Overview

The core of MusiCube lies in its ability to generate music by analyzing the user's interactions with a dynamic 3D interface. The interface consists of various cubes, each serving a distinct purpose:

- **Controller Cube (White)**: This cube serves as the user's avatar within the 3D space. Users can navigate it using the arrow keys.

- **Collision Cubes (Green and Cyan)**: The environment is adorned with green and cyan cubes. Colliding with these cubes triggers different musical effects.

## User Interactions

MusiCube leverages user interactions to influence the music generation process:

- **Green Cube Collisions**: Upon colliding with a green cube, the musicgen model generates a music genre token such as soothing, guitar, rock, pop, and more. These tokens are collected in a prompt list that serves as the basis for music generation. For example, colliding with green cubes that generate tokens like soothing, guitar, and rock results in the prompt list [soothing, guitar, rock].

- **Cyan Cube Collisions**: Colliding with a cyan cube removes the last token from the prompt list. This interaction allows users to fine-tune their music prompt.

## Scoring System

MusiCube incorporates a scoring system to gamify the experience:

- Green cube collisions add points to the user's score, incentivizing interactions.
- Cyan cube collisions subtract points, encouraging strategic decisions.

## Music Generation and Playback

The accumulated prompt list is sent to the musicgen model after a series of collisions. The model then generates music based on the provided prompts. The resulting composition is played in a loop until a new prompt is constructed through further interactions.
